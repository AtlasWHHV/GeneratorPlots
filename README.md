# GeneratorPlotsAlt

**HISTORY**

1) 20170128 Alternate GeneratorPlots which compiles easily as a precursor to creating and running steering macros.
2) 20170207 Alternate GeneratorPlots which compiles easily creating and running steering macros as a precursor to adding objects and tools for analysis.

**NOTES**

This repository has been tested to compile correctly.

PLEASE NOTE: the following files have been modified as of 20170207

1) PlotGeneratorQuantities.cxx

Some stuff that I modified originally is commented with "GitHubProgramCode added."

I left in "#include iostream" and "#include string" in PlotGeneratorQuantities.cxx so I could see the various "cout" print statements to know that the code was compiling up until that point and troubleshoot various issues (please see Issues n GitHub), but commented it out of MyxAODAnalysis.cxx until I could figure out how to convert from ints to strings.  These devices can be deleted at any time.

**To run the program, do the following:**

1) Navigate to /phys/groups/tev/scratch4/users/nicolasNDS/GeneratorPlotsAltMast and copy the file DAOD_TRUTH0.5000_events_v2.pool.root and paste into your working directory.

2) Navigate to the working directory where you've cloned "GeneratorPlotsAlt" (do NOT cd into "GeneratorPlotsAlt").

3) Perform the following steps in the Terminal:

`bash`

`setupATLAS`

`lsetup 'rcSetup Base,2.4.14'`

`rc find_packages`

`rc compile`

`PlotGeneratorQuantities`

Several different outputs will be created in a folder called "SubmitDir" in your working directory.

If you get any errors either in performing `rc find_packages` or `rc compile` then something went wrong somewhere along the way.

If you did everything correctly, in the Terminal you will see it print every 100 events from 0 to 500 so you know where you are.  You have to be a bit patient; your /hist and /input directories will not display until the program has finished running.

If you want to view more information, use the root command to look at the .root file(s) created in your submitDir.

WARNING: If you attempt to rerun the program again without first deleting the "submitDir" folder, it'll throw an error!
